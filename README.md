# Hand Gesture-Based Media Control System

A real-time **hand gesture controlled media system** built using **Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI**.  
This project allows users to control media playback (play/pause, volume, and track navigation) using simple hand gestures captured through a webcam.
